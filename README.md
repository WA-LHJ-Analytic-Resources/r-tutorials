# r-tutorials
Tutorials for common R workflows, presented at R Office Hours

Each notebook focuses on a different topic. The goal of the notebooks is to show examples of the topic on public health-style data. 
All data needed to run these notebooks can be found in the data folder in this repo. The data is all publicly available, or is synthetic data that has been create to mimic real world public-health data.

The notebooks (found in the notebooks folder) are:
- exploratory_data_analysis: this notebook shows an example of how to start exploring a data set, including cleaning the data, grouping and combining data, calculating summary statistics, and visualizing the data
- survey_analysis: this notebook gives examples of how to analyze survey data, using the R {survey} package
